## **Part III: Special Provisions for Target Demographics**

### **Analysis of Provisions**

Across schemes, there is a clear policy to provide targeted support to ensure inclusive growth.

* **Small and Marginal Farmers:** The most common provision is a higher subsidy rate, typically a 10-15 percentage point increase (e.g., 55% vs 45% in PMKSY-PDMC). This directly offsets their limited capital.  
* **Women Farmers (Mahila Kisan):** Support is evolving beyond simple financial incentives. While many schemes offer higher subsidies (e.g., 50% under SMAM), others like PKVY give preference to women's SHGs in cluster formation, recognizing their role in collective action.  
* **Scheduled Caste (SC) / Scheduled Tribe (ST) Farmers:** This is the most consistent special provision, often manifested as significantly higher subsidy rates (e.g., 90% vs 80%/50% in Karnataka's Krishi Bhagya). Some states also design schemes exclusively for these communities.  
* **Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs):** There is an increasing policy emphasis on FPOs as a primary vehicle for development. Schemes for high-cost infrastructure (Cold Chain, NLM, MIDH) explicitly list FPOs as key eligible entities, allowing the government to channel larger, more impactful investments that benefit a collective of farmers. This represents a strategic shift from an individual-centric to a collective-centric subsidy model.
